This is a project from Alura Next Education. It represents the first steps of a larger project focused on HTML, Java, and CSS, aimed at enhancing my learning experience. 

Through this project, I aim to build a strong foundation in web development, exploring various techniques and best practices.

The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive and dynamic web application that showcases 
my skills and knowledge. 

This journey will not only help me improve my technical abilities but also prepare me for future challenges in the field of web development.
